  decidedly pacific. — Phokion and Demades were leading ministers
  at Athens — they were of macedonizing politics. — Demosthenes

  nevertheless still public men of importance. Financial activity
  of Lykurgus. — Position of Demosthenes — his prudent conduct
  — Anti-Macedonian movement from Sparta — King Agis visits the
  Persian admirals in the Ægean. His attempts both in Krete and
  in the Peloponnesus. — Agis levies an army in Peloponnesus,

  Coronâ. — Funeral oration of extinct Grecian freedom. — Verdict

  sequestrate his treasure for Alexander. — Demosthenes moves the
  decree for arrest of Harpalus, who is arrested, but escapes. —
  Conduct of Demosthenes in regard to the treasure of Harpalus —
  deficiency of the sum counted and realized, as compared with
  the sum announced by Harpalus. — Suspicions about this money —
  Demosthenes moves that the Areopagus shall investigate the matter
  — the Areopagites bring in a report against Demosthenes himself,
  with Demades and others, as guilty of corrupt appropriation.
  Demosthenes is tried on this charge, condemned, and goes into
  exile. — Was Demosthenes guilty of such corrupt appropriation?
  Circumstances as known in the case. — Demosthenes could not have
  received the money from Harpalus, since he opposed him from first
  to last. — Had Demosthenes the means of embezzling, after the
  money had passed out of the control of Harpalus? Answer in the
  negative. Accusatory speech of Deinarchus — virulent invective

HISTORY OF GREECE.




CHAPTER XCI.

FIRST PERIOD OF THE REIGN OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT — SIEGE AND CAPTURE
OF THEBES.


My last preceding volume ended with the assassination of Philip of
Macedon, and the accession of his son Alexander the Great, then
twenty years of age.

It demonstrates the altered complexion of Grecian history, that we
are now obliged to seek for marking events in the succession to
the Macedonian crown, or in the ordinances of Macedonian kings. In
fact, the Hellenic world has ceased to be autonomous. In Sicily,
indeed, the free and constitutional march, revived by Timoleon,
is still destined to continue for a few years longer; but all the
Grecian cities south of Mount Olympus have descended into dependents
of Macedonia. Such dependence, established as a fact by the battle
of Chæroneia and by the subsequent victorious march of Philip over
Peloponnesus, was acknowledged in form by the vote of the Grecian
synod at Corinth. While even the Athenians had been compelled to
concur in submission, Sparta alone, braving all consequences,
continued inflexible in her refusal. The adherence of Thebes was not
trusted to the word of the Thebans, but ensured by the Macedonian
garrison established in her citadel, called the Kadmeia. Each
Hellenic city, small and great,—maritime, inland, and insular—(with
the single exception of Sparta), was thus enrolled as a separate unit
in the list of subject-allies attached to the imperial headship of
Philip.

Under these circumstances, the history of conquered Greece loses its
separate course, and becomes merged in that of conquering Macedonia.
Nevertheless, there are particular reasons which constrain the
historian of Greece to carry on the two together for a few years
longer. First, conquered Greece exercised a powerful action on her
conqueror—“Græcia capta ferum victorem cepit”. The Macedonians,
though speaking a language of their own, had neither language for
communicating with others, nor literature, nor philosophy, except
Grecian and derived from Greeks. Philip, while causing himself to be
chosen chief of Hellas, was himself not only partially hellenized,
but an eager candidate for Hellenic admiration. He demanded the
headship under the declared pretence of satisfying the old antipathy
against Persia. Next, the conquests of Alexander, though essentially
Macedonian, operated indirectly as the initiatory step of a series
of events, diffusing Hellenic language (with some tinge of Hellenic
literature) over a large breadth of Asia,—opening that territory to
the better observation, in some degree even to the superintendence,
of intelligent Greeks—and thus producing consequences important in
many ways to the history of mankind. Lastly, the generation of free
Greeks upon whom the battle of Chæroneia fell, were not disposed
to lie quiet if any opportunity occurred for shaking off their
Macedonian masters. The present volume will record the unavailing
efforts made for this purpose, in which Demosthenes and most of the
other leaders perished.

Alexander (born in July 356 B. C.), like his father Philip,
was not a Greek, but a Macedonian and Epirot, partially imbued with
Grecian sentiment and intelligence. It is true that his ancestors,
some centuries before, had been emigrants from Argos; but the kings
of Macedonia had long lost all trace of any such peculiarity as might
originally have distinguished them from their subjects. The basis of
Philip’s character was Macedonian, not Greek: it was the self-will of
a barbarian prince, not the _ingenium civile_, or sense of reciprocal
obligation and right in society with others, which marked more or
less even the most powerful members of a Grecian city, whether
oligarchical or democratical. If this was true of Philip, it was
still more true of Alexander, who inherited the violent temperament
and headstrong will of his furious Epirotic mother Olympias.

A kinsman of Olympias, named Leonidas, and an Akarnanian named
Lysimachus, are mentioned as the chief tutors to whom Alexander’s
childhood was entrusted.[1] Of course the Iliad of Homer was among
the first things which he learnt as a boy. Throughout most of his
life, he retained a passionate interest in this poem, a copy of
which, said to have been corrected by Aristotle, he carried with him
in his military campaigns. We are not told, nor is it probable, that
he felt any similar attachment for the less warlike Odyssey. Even as
a child, he learnt to identify himself in sympathy with Achilles,—his
ancestor by the mother’s side, according to the Æakid pedigree. The
tutor Lysimachus won his heart by calling himself Phœnix—Alexander,
Achilles—and Philip, by the name of Peleus. Of Alexander’s boyish
poetical recitations, one anecdote remains, both curious and of
unquestionable authenticity. He was ten years old, when the Athenian
legation, including both Æschines and Demosthenes, came to Pella to
treat about peace. While Philip entertained them at table, in his
usual agreeable and convivial manner, the boy Alexander recited for
their amusement certain passages of poetry which he had learnt—and
delivered, in response with another boy, a dialogue out of one of the
Grecian dramas.[2]

  [1] Plutarch, Alexand. c. 5, 6.

  [2] Æschines cont. Timarch. p. 167.

At the age of thirteen, Alexander was placed under the instruction of
Aristotle, whom Philip expressly invited for the purpose, and whose
father Nikomachus had been both friend and physician of Philip’s
father Amyntas. What course of study Alexander was made to go
through, we unfortunately cannot state. He enjoyed the teaching of
Aristotle for at least three years, and we are told that he devoted
himself to it with ardor, contracting a strong attachment to his
preceptor. His powers of addressing an audience, though not so well
attested as those of his father, were always found sufficient for his
purpose: moreover, he retained, even in the midst of his fatiguing
Asiatic campaigns, an interest in Greek literature and poetry.

At what precise moment, during the lifetime of his father, Alexander
first took part in active service, we do not know. It is said that
once, when quite a youth, he received some Persian envoys during the
absence of his father; and that he surprised them by the maturity of
his demeanor, as well as by the political bearing and pertinence of
his questions.[3] Though only sixteen years of age, in 340 B.
C., he was left at home as regent while Philip was engaged in
the sieges of Byzantium and Perinthus. He put down a revolt of the
neighboring Thracian tribe called Mædi, took one of their towns, and
founded it anew under the title of Alexandria; the earliest town
which bore that name, afterwards applied to so many other towns
planted by him. In the march of Philip into Greece (338 B.
C.), Alexander took part, commanded one of the wings at the
battle of Chæroneia, and is said to have first gained the advantage
on his side over the Theban sacred band.[4]

  [3] Plutarch, Alex. 5.

  [4] Plutarch, Alex. 9. Justin says that Alexander was the
  companion of his father during part of the war in Thrace (ix. 1).

Yet notwithstanding such marks of confidence and coöperation, other
incidents occurred producing bitter animosity between the father and
the son. By his wife Olympias, Philip had as offspring Alexander
and Kleopatra: by a Thessalian mistress named Philinna, he had a
son named Aridæus (afterwards called Philip Aridæus:) he had also
daughters named Kynna (or Kynanê) and Thessalonikê. Olympias, a
woman of sanguinary and implacable disposition, had rendered herself
so odious to him, that he repudiated her, and married a new wife
named Kleopatra. I have recounted in the preceding volume[5] the
indignation felt by Alexander at this proceeding, and the violent
altercation which occurred during the conviviality of the marriage
banquet; where Philip actually snatched his sword, threatened his
son’s life, and was only prevented from executing the threat by
falling down through intoxication. After this quarrel, Alexander
retired from Macedonia, conducting his mother to her brother
Alexander king of Epirus. A son was born to Philip by Kleopatra.
Her brother or uncle Attalus acquired high favor. Her kinsmen and
partisans generally were also promoted, while Ptolemy, Nearchus, and
other persons attached to Alexander, were banished.[6]

  [6] Plutarch, Alex. 10. Arrian, iii. 6, 8.

The prospects of Alexander were thus full of uncertainty and peril,
up to the very day of Philip’s assassination. The succession to the
Macedonian crown, though transmitted in the same family, was by no
means assured as to individual members; moreover, in the regal house
of Macedonia[7] (as among the kings called Diadochi, who acquired
dominion after the death of Alexander the Great), violent feuds and
standing mistrust between father, sons, and brethren, were ordinary
phænomena, to which the family of the Antigonids formed an honorable
exception. Between Alexander and Olympias on the one side, and
Kleopatra with her son and Attalus on the other, a murderous contest
was sure to arise. Kleopatra was at this time in the ascendent;
Olympias was violent and mischievous; and Philip was only forty-seven
years of age. Hence the future threatened nothing but aggravated
dissension and difficulties for Alexander. Moreover his strong
will and imperious temper, eminently suitable for supreme command,
disqualified him from playing a subordinate part, even to his own
father. The prudence of Philip, when about to depart on his Asiatic
expedition, induced him to attempt to heal these family dissensions
by giving his daughter Kleopatra in marriage to her uncle Alexander
of Epirus, brother of Olympias. It was during the splendid marriage
festival, then celebrated at Ægæ, that he was assassinated—Olympias,
Kleopatra, and Alexander, being all present, while Attalus was in
Asia, commanding the Macedonian division sent forward in advance,
jointly with Parmenio. Had Philip escaped this catastrophe, he
would doubtless have carried on the war in Asia Minor with quite as
much energy and skill as it was afterwards prosecuted by Alexander:
though we may doubt whether the father would have stretched out to
those ulterior undertakings which, gigantic and far-reaching as
they were, fell short of the insatiable ambition of the son. But
successful as Philip might have been in Asia, he would hardly have
escaped gloomy family feuds; with Alexander as a mutinous son, under
the instigations of Olympias,—and with Kleopatra on the other side,
feeling that her own safety depended upon the removal of regal or
quasi-regal competitors.

  [7] See the third chapter of Plutarch’s life of Demetrius
  Poliorkêtês; which presents a vivid description of the feelings
  prevalent between members of regal families in those ages.
  Demetrius, coming home from the chase with his hunting javelins
  in his hand, goes up to his father Antigonus, salutes him, and
  sits down by his side without disarming. This is extolled as an
  unparalleled proof of the confidence and affection subsisting
  between the father and the son. In the families of all the other
  Diadochi (says Plutarch) murders of sons, mothers, and wives,
  were frequent—murders of brothers were even common, assumed to be
  precautions necessary for security. Οὕτως ἄρα πάντη δυσκωνοίνητον
  ἡ ἀρχὴ καὶ μεστὸν ἀπιστίας καὶ δυσνοίας, ὥστε ἀγάλλεσθαι τὸν
  μέγιστον τῶν Ἀλεξάνδρου διαδόχων καὶ πρεσβύτατον, ὅτι μὴ φοβεῖται
  τὸν υἱὸν, ἀλλὰ προσίεται τὴν λόγχην ἔχοντα τοῦ σώματος πλήσιον.
  Οὐ μὴν ἀλλὰ καὶ μόνος, ὡς εἰπεῖν, ~ὁ οἶκος οὗτος~ ἐπὶ πλείστας

  διαδοχαὶ πολλῶν μὲν ἔχουσι παίδων, πολλῶν δὲ μητέρων φόνους καὶ
  γυναικῶν· τὸ μὲν γὰρ ἀδελφοὺς ἀναιρεῖν, ὥσπερ οἱ γεωμέτραι τὰ
  αἰτήματα λαμβάνουσιν, οὕτω ~συνεχωρεῖτο κοινόν τι νομιζόμενον
  αἴτημα καὶ βασιλικὸν~ ὑπὲρ ἀσφαλείας.

  Compare Tacitus, Histor. v. 8, about the family feuds of the
  kings of Judæa; and Xenoph. Hieron. iii. 8.

  In noticing the Antigonid family as a favorable exception, we
  must confine our assertion to the first century of that family.
  The bloody tragedy of Perseus and Demetrius shortly preceded the
  ruin of the empire.

From such formidable perils, visible in the distance, if not
immediately impending, the sword of Pausanias guaranteed both
Alexander and the Macedonian kingdom. But at the moment when the blow
was struck, and when the Lynkestian Alexander, one of those privy
to it, ran to forestall resistance and place the crown on the head
of Alexander the Great[8]—no one knew what to expect from the young
prince thus suddenly exalted at the age of twenty years. The sudden
death of Philip in the fulness of glory and ambitious hopes, must
have produced the strongest impression, first upon the festive crowd
assembled,—next throughout Macedonia,—lastly, upon the foreigners
whom he had reduced to dependence, from the Danube to the borders
of Pæonia. All these dependencies were held only by the fear of
Macedonian force. It remained to be proved whether the youthful son
of Philip was capable of putting down opposition and upholding the
powerful organization created by his father. Moreover Perdikkas,
the elder brother and predecessor of Philip, had left a son named
Amyntas, now at least twenty-four years of age, to whom many looked
as the proper successor.[9]

But Alexander, present and proclaimed at once by his friends, showed
himself both in word and deed, perfectly competent to the emergency.
He mustered, caressed, and conciliated, the divisions of the
Macedonian army and the chief officers. His addresses were judicious
and energetic, engaging that the dignity of the kingdom should be
maintained unimpaired,[10] and that even the Asiatic projects already
proclaimed should be prosecuted with as much vigor as if Philip still
lived.

  [10] Diod. xvii. 2.

It was one of the first measures of Alexander to celebrate with
magnificent solemnities the funeral of his deceased father. While
the preparations for it were going on, he instituted researches
to find out and punish the accomplices of Pausanias. Of these
indeed, the most illustrious person mentioned to us—Olympias—was
not only protected by her position from punishment, but retained
great ascendency over her son to the end of his life. Three
other persons are mentioned by name as accomplices—brothers and
persons of good family from the district of Upper Macedonia called
Lynkêstis—Alexander, Heromenes, and Arrhabæus, sons of Aëropus. The
two latter were put to death, but the first of the three was spared,
and even promoted to important charges, as a reward for his useful
forwardness in instantly saluting Alexander king.[11] Others also,
we know not how many, were executed; and Alexander seems to have
imagined that there still remained some undetected.[12] The Persian
king boasted in public letters,[13] with how much truth we cannot
say, that he too had been among the instigators of Pausanias.

  [11] Arrian, i. 25, 2; Curtius, vii. 1, 6. Alexander son
  of Aëropus was son-in-law of Antipater. The case of this
  Alexander—and of Olympias—afforded a certain basis to those who
  said (Curtius, vi. 43) that Alexander had dealt favorably with
  the accomplices of Pausanias.

  [12] Plutarch, Alexand. 10-27; Diodor. xvii. 51; Justin, xi. 11.

  [13] Arrian, ii. 14, 10.

Among the persons slain about this time by Alexander, we may number
his first-cousin and brother-in-law Amyntas—son of Perdikkas (the
elder brother of the deceased Philip): Amyntas was a boy when his
father Perdikkas died. Though having a preferable claim to the
succession, according to usage, he had been put aside by his uncle
Philip, on the ground of his age and of the strenuous efforts
required on commencing a new reign. Philip had however given in
marriage to this Amyntas his daughter (by an Illyrian mother) Kynna.
Nevertheless, Alexander now put him to death,[14] on accusation of
conspiracy: under what precise circumstances, does not appear—but
probably Amyntas (who besides being the son of Philip’s elder
brother, was at least twenty-four years of age, while Alexander
was only twenty) conceived himself as having a better right to the
succession, and was so conceived by many others. The infant son of
Kleopatra by Philip is said to have been killed by Alexander, as a
rival in the succession; Kleopatra herself was afterwards put to
death by Olympias during his absence, and to his regret. Attalus,
also, uncle of Kleopatra and joint commander of the Macedonian army
in Asia, was assassinated under the private orders of Alexander, by
Hekatæus and Philotas.[15] Another Amyntas, son of Antiochus (there
seems to have been several Macedonians named Amyntas) fled for safety
into Asia:[16] probably others, who felt themselves to be objects of
suspicion, did the like—since by the Macedonian custom, not merely a
person convicted of high treason, but all his kindred along with him,
were put to death.[17]

  [14] Curtius, vi. 9, 17. vi. 10, 24. Arrian mentioned this
  Amyntas son of Perdikkas (as well as the fact of his having been
  put to death by Alexander before the Asiatic expedition), in
  the lost work τὰ μετὰ Ἀλέξανδρον—see Photius Cod. 92. p. 220.
  But Arrian, in his account of Alexander’s expedition, _does not
  mention_ the fact; which shows that his silence is not to be
  assumed as a conclusive reason for discrediting allegations of
  others.

  Compare Polyænus, v. 60; and Plutarch, Fort. Alex. Magn. p. 327.

  It was during this expedition into Thrace and Illyria, about
  eight months after his accession, that Alexander promised to
  give his sister Kynna in marriage to Langarus prince of the
  Agrianes (Arrian, Exp. Al. M. i. 5, 7). Langarus died of sickness
  soon after; so that this marriage never took place. But when
  the promise was made, Kynna must have been a widow. Her husband
  Amyntas must therefore have been put to death during the first
  months of Alexander’s reign.

  [15] See my last preceding volume, Chap. xc. p. 518; Diod. xvii.

  [16] Arrian, i. 17 10; Plutarch, Alex. 20, Curtius, iii. 28, 18.

  [17] Curtius, vi. 42, 20. Compare with this custom, a passage in
  the Ajax of Sophokles, v. 725.

By unequivocal manifestations of energy and address, and by
despatching rivals or dangerous malcontents, Alexander thus speedily
fortified his position on the throne at home. But from the foreign
dependents of Macedonia—Greeks, Thracians, and Illyrians—the like
acknowledgment was not so easily obtained. Most of them were disposed
to throw off the yoke; yet none dared to take the initiative of
moving, and the suddenness of Philip’s death found them altogether
unprepared for combination. By that event the Greeks were discharged
from all engagement, since the vote of the confederacy had elected
him personally as Imperator. They were now at liberty, in so far
as there was any liberty at all in the proceeding, to elect any
one else, or to abstain from reëlecting at all, and even to let
the confederacy expire. Now it was only under constraint and
intimidation, as was well known both in Greece and Macedonia, that
they had conferred this dignity even on Philip—who had earned it by
splendid exploits, and had proved himself the ablest captain and
politician of the age. They were by no means inclined to transfer
it to a youth like Alexander, until he had shown himself capable
of bringing the like coercion to bear, and extorting the same
submission. The wish to break loose from Macedonia, widely spread
throughout the Grecian cities, found open expression from Demosthenes
and others in the assembly at Athens. That orator (if we are to
believe his rival Æschines), having received private intelligence of
the assassination of Philip, through certain spies of Charidemus,
before it was publicly known to others—pretended to have had it
revealed to him in a dream by the gods. Appearing in the assembly
with his gayest attire, he congratulated his countrymen on the death
of their greatest enemy, and pronounced high encomiums on the brave
tyrannicide of Pausanias, which he would probably compare to that
of Harmodius and Aristogeiton.[18] He depreciated the abilities of
Alexander, calling him Margites (the name of a silly character in
one of the Homeric poems), and intimating that he would be too much
distracted with embarrassments and ceremonial duties at home, to have
leisure for a foreign march.[19] Such, according to Æschines, was
the language of Demosthenes on the first news of Philip’s death. We
cannot doubt that the public of Athens, as well as Demosthenes, felt
great joy at an event which seemed to open to them fresh chances of
freedom, and that the motion for a sacrifice of thanksgiving,[20]
in spite of Phokion’s opposition, was readily adopted. But though
the manifestation of sentiment at Athens was thus anti-Macedonian,
exhibiting aversion to the renewal of that obedience which had been
recently promised to Philip, Demosthenes did not go so far as to
declare any positive hostility.[21] He tried to open communication
with the Persians in Asia Minor, and also, if we may believe
Diodorus, with the Macedonian commander in Asia Minor, Attalus. But
neither of the two missions was successful. Attalus sent his letter
to Alexander; while the Persian king,[22] probably relieved by the
death of Philip from immediate fear of Macedonian power, despatched
a peremptory refusal to Athens, intimating that he would furnish no
more money.[23]

  [19] Æschines adv. Ktesiph. p. 547. c. 50.

  [20] Plutarch, Phokion, 16.

  [21] We gather this from Æschines adv. Ktesiph. p. 551. c. 52.

  [22] Diodorus (xvii. 5) mentions this communication of
  Demosthenes to Attalus; which, however, I cannot but think
  improbable. Probably Charidemus was the organ of the
  communications.

  [23] This letter from Darius is distinctly alluded to, and even
  a sentence cited from it, by Æschines adv. Ktesiph. p. 633, 634.
  c. 88. We know that Darius wrote in very different language
  not long afterwards, near the time when Alexander crossed into
  Asia (Arrian, ii. 14, 11). The first letter must have been sent
  shortly after Philip’s death, when Darius was publicly boasting
  of having procured the deed, and before he had yet learnt to fear
  Alexander. Compare Diodor. xvii. 7.

Not merely in Athens, but in other Grecian States also, the death
of Philip excited aspirations for freedom. The Lacedæmonians, who,
though unsupported, had stood out inflexibly against any obedience
to him, were now on the watch for new allies; while the Arcadians,
Argeians, and Eleians, manifested sentiments adverse to Macedonia.
The Ambrakiots expelled the garrison placed by Philip in their city;
the Ætolians passed a vote to assist in restoring those Akarnanian
exiles whom he had banished.[24] On the other hand, the Thessalians
manifested unshaken adherence to Macedonia. But the Macedonian
garrison at Thebes, and the macedonizing Thebans who now governed
that city,[25] were probably the main obstacles to any combined
manifestation in favor of Hellenic autonomy.

  [24] Diodor. xvii. 3.

  [25] Diodorus (xvii. 3) says that the Thebans passed a vote to
  expel the Macedonian garrison in the Kadmeia. But I have little
  hesitation in rejecting this statement. We may be sure that
  the presence of the Macedonian garrison was connected with the
  predominance in the city of a party favorable to Macedonia. In
  the ensuing year, when the resistance really occurred, this was
  done by the anti-Macedonian party, who then got back from exile.

Apprised of these impulses prevalent throughout the Grecian world,
Alexander felt the necessity of checking them by a demonstration
immediate, as well as intimidating. The energy and rapidity of his
proceedings speedily overawed all those who had speculated on his
youth, or had adopted the epithets applied to him by Demosthenes.
Having surmounted, in a shorter time than was supposed possible,
the difficulties of his newly-acquired position at home, he marched
into Greece at the head of a formidable army, seemingly about two
months after the death of Philip. He was favorably received by the
Thessalians, who passed a vote constituting Alexander head of Greece
in place of his father Philip; which vote was speedily confirmed by
the Amphiktyonic assembly, convoked at Thermopylæ. Alexander next
advanced to Thebes, and from thence over the isthmus of Corinth
into Peloponnesus. The details of his march we do not know; but
his great force, probably not inferior to that which had conquered
at Chæroneia, spread terror everywhere, silencing all except his
partisans. Nowhere was the alarm greater than at Athens. The
Athenians recollecting both the speeches of their orators and the
votes of their assembly,—offensive at least, if not hostile, to the
Macedonians—trembled lest the march of Alexander should be directed
against their city, and accordingly made preparation for standing
a siege. All citizens were enjoined to bring in their families and
properties from the country, insomuch that the space within the walls
was full both of fugitives and of cattle.[26] At the same time, the
assembly adopted, on the motion of Demades, a resolution of apology
and full submission to Alexander: they not only recognized him as
chief of Greece, but conferred upon him divine honors, in terms
even more emphatic than those bestowed on Philip.[27] The mover,
with other legates, carried the resolution to Alexander, whom they
found at Thebes, and who accepted their submission. A young speaker
named Pytheas is said to have opposed the vote in the Athenian
assembly.[28] Whether Demosthenes did the like—or whether, under the
feeling of disappointed anticipations and overwhelming Macedonian
force, he condemned himself to silence,—we cannot say. That he did
not go with Demades on the mission to Alexander, seems a matter of
course, though he is said to have been appointed by public vote to
do so, and to have declined the duty. He accompanied the legation
as far as Mount Kithæron, on the frontier, and then returned to
Athens.[29] We read with astonishment that Æschines and his other
enemies denounced this step as a cowardly desertion. No envoy could
be so odious to Alexander, or so likely to provoke refusal for the
proposition which he carried, as Demosthenes. To employ him in such
a mission would have been absurd; except for the purpose probably
intended by his enemies, that he might be either detained by the
conqueror as an expiatory victim,[30] or sent back as a pardoned and
humiliated prisoner.

  (Plutarch confounds the proceedings of this year with those of
  the succeeding year). Demades, in the fragment of his oration
  remaining to us, makes no allusion to this proceeding of
  Demosthenes.

  The decree, naming Demosthenes among the envoys, is likely enough
  to have been passed chiefly by the votes of his enemies. It was
  always open to an Athenian citizen to accept or decline such an
  appointment.

  [30] Several years afterwards, Demades himself was put to death
  by Antipater, to whom he had been sent as envoy from Athens
  (Diodor. xviii. 48).

After displaying his force in various portions of Peloponnesus,
Alexander returned to Corinth, where he convened deputies from the
Grecian cities generally. The list of those cities which obeyed
the summons is not before us, but probably it included nearly all
the cities of Central Greece. We know only that the Lacedæmonians
continued to stand aloof, refusing all concurrence. Alexander asked
from the assembled deputies the same appointment which the victorious
Philip had required and obtained two years before—the hegemony or
headship of the Greeks collectively for the purpose of prosecuting
war against Persia.[31] To the request of a prince at the head of an
irresistible army, one answer only was admissible. He was nominated
Imperator with full powers, by land and sea. Overawed by the presence
and sentiment of Macedonian force, all acquiesced in this vote except
the Lacedæmonians.

  [31] Arrian, i. 1, 2. αἰτεῖν παρ᾽ αὐτῶν τὴν ἡγεμονίαν τῆς ἐπὶ
  τοὺς Πέρσας στρατείας, ἥντινα Φιλίππῳ ἤδη ἔδοσαν· καὶ αἰτήσαντα
  λαβεῖν παρὰ πάντων, πλὴν Λακεδαιμονίων, etc.

  Arrian speaks as if this request had been addressed only to the
  Greeks _within_ Peloponnesus; moreover he mentions no assembly
  at Corinth, which is noticed (though with some confusion) by
  Diodorus, Justin, and Plutarch. Cities out of Peloponnesus,
  as well as within it, must have been included; unless we
  suppose that the resolution of the Amphiktyonic assembly, which
  had been previously passed, was held to comprehend all the
  extra-Peloponnesian cities, which seems not probable.

The convention sanctioned by Alexander was probably the same as that
settled by and with his father Philip. Its grand and significant
feature was, that it recognized Hellas as a confederacy under the
Macedonian prince as imperator, president, or executive head and
arm. It crowned him with a legal sanction as keeper of the peace
within Greece, and conqueror abroad in the name of Greece. Of its
other conditions, some are made known to us by subsequent complaints;
such conditions as, being equitable and tutelary towards the members
generally, the Macedonian chief found it inconvenient to observe,
and speedily began to violate. Each Hellenic city was pronounced,
by the first article of the convention, to be free and autonomous.
In each, the existing political constitution was recognized as it
stood; all other cities were forbidden to interfere with it, or to
second any attack by its hostile exiles.[32] No new despot was to
be established; no dispossessed despot was to be restored.[33] Each
city became bound to discourage in every other, as far as possible,
all illegal violence—such as political executions, confiscation,
spoliation, redivision of land or abolition of debts, factious
manumission of slaves, etc.[34] To each was guaranteed freedom of
navigation; maritime capture was prohibited, on pain of enmity from
all.[35] Each was forbidden to send armed vessels into the harbor of
any other, or to build vessels or engage seamen there.[36] By each,
an oath was taken to observe these conditions, to declare war against
all who violated them, and to keep them inscribed on a commemorative
column. Provision seems to have been made for admitting any
additional city[37] on its subsequent application, though it might
not have been a party to the original contract. Moreover, it appears
that a standing military force, under Macedonian orders, was provided
to enforce observance of the convention; and that the synod of
deputies was contemplated as likely to meet periodically.[38]

  mentioned as if it were one specially binding the Macedonians
  not to sail with armed ships into the Peiræus. This undoubtedly
  is the particular case on which the orator insists; but I
  conceive it to have been only a particular case under a general
  prohibitory rule.

  [37] Arrian, ii. 1, 7; ii. 2, 4. Demosth. de Fœd. Alex, p. 213.
  Tenedos, Mitylênê, Antissa, and Eresus, can hardly have been
  members of the convention when first sworn.

  συγκατασκευάζουσιν, etc. (p. 216).

  The persons designated by οἱ δὲ, and denounced throughout this
  oration generally, are, Alexander or the Macedonian officers and
  soldiers.

  A passage in Deinarchus cont. Demosth. p. 14, leads to the
  supposition, that a standing Macedonian force was kept at
  Corinth, occupying the Isthmus. The Thebans, however, declared
  against Macedonia (in August or September 335 B. C.),
  and proceeding to besiege the Macedonian garrison in the Kadmeia,
  sent envoys to entreat aid from the Arcadians. “These envoys
  (says Deinarchus) got with difficulty by sea to the Arcadians”—οἳ
  κατὰ θάλασσαν ~μόλις~ ἀφίκοντο πρὸς ἐκείνους. Whence should this
  difficulty arise, except from a Macedonian occupation of Corinth?

Such was the convention, in so far as we know its terms, agreed
to by the Grecian deputies at Corinth with Alexander; but with
Alexander at the head of an irresistible army. He proclaimed it as
the “public statute of the Greeks”,[39] constituting a paramount
obligation, of which he was the enforcer, binding on all, and
authorizing him to treat all transgressors as rebels. It was set
forth as counterpart of, and substitute for, the convention of
Antalkidas, which we shall presently see the officers of Darius
trying to revive against him—the headship of Persia against that of
Macedonia. Such is the melancholy degradation of the Grecian World,
that its cities have no alternative except to choose between these
two foreign potentates—or to invite the help of Darius, the most
distant and least dangerous, whose headship could hardly be more than
nominal, against a neighbor sure to be domineering and compressive,
and likely enough to be tyrannical. Of the once powerful Hellenic
chiefs and competitors—Sparta, Athens, Thebes—under each of whom the
Grecian world had been upheld as an independent and self-determining
aggregate, admitting the free play of native sentiment and character,
under circumstances more or less advantageous—the two last are now
confounded as common units (one even held under garrison) among the
subject allies of Alexander; while Sparta preserves only the dignity
of an isolated independence.

  [39] Arrian, i. 16, 10. παρὰ τὰ κοινῇ δόξαντα τοῖς Ἕλλησιν.
  After the death of Darius, Alexander pronounced that the Grecian
  mercenaries who had been serving with that prince, were highly
  criminal for having contravened the general vote of the Greeks
  (παρὰ τὰ δόγματα τὰ Ἑλλήνων), except such as had taken service
  before that vote was passed, and except the Sinopeans, whom
  Alexander considered as subjects of Persia and not partakers τοῦ
  κοινοῦ τῶν Ἑλλήνων (Arrian, iii. 23, 15; iii. 24, 8, 9).

It appears that during the nine months which succeeded the swearing
of the convention, Alexander and his officers (after his return to
Macedonia) were active, both by armed force and by mission of envoys,
in procuring new adhesions and in re-modelling the governments of
various cities suitably to their own views. Complaints of such
aggressions were raised in the public assembly of Athens, the only
place in Greece where any liberty of discussion still survived.
An oration, pronounced by Demosthenes, Hyperides, or one of the
contemporary, anti-Macedonian politicians (about the spring or early
summer of 335 B. C.),[40] imparts to us some idea both of
the Macedonian interventions steadily going on, and of the unavailing
remonstrances raised against them by individual Athenian citizens. At
the time of this oration, such remonstrances had already been often
repeated. They were always met by the macedonizing Athenians with
peremptory declarations that the convention must be observed. But
in reply, the remonstrants urged, that it was unfair to call upon
Athens for strict observance of the convention, while the Macedonians
and their partisans in the various cities were perpetually violating
it for their own profit. Alexander and his officers (affirms this
orator) had never once laid down their arms since the convention was
settled. They had been perpetually tampering with the governments
of the various cities, to promote their own partisans to power.[41]
In Messênê, Sikyon, and Pellênê, they had subverted the popular
constitutions, banished many citizens, and established friends of
their own as despots. The Macedonian force, destined as a public
guarantee to enforce the observance of the convention, had been
employed only to overrule its best conditions, and to arm the
hands of factious partisans.[42] Thus Alexander in his capacity of
Imperator, disregarding all the restraints of the convention, acted
as chief despot for the maintenance of subordinate despots in the
separate cities.[43] Even at Athens, this imperial authority had
rescinded sentences of the dikastery, and compelled the adoption of
measures contrary to the laws and constitution.[44]

  [40] This is the oration περὶ τῶν πρὸς Ἀλέξανδρον συνθηκῶν
  already more than once alluded to above. Though standing among
  the Demosthenic works, it is supposed by Libanius as well as by
  most modern critics not to be the production of Demosthenes—upon
  internal grounds of style, which are certainly forcible. Libanius
  says that it bears much resemblance to the style of Hyperides.
  At any rate, there seems no reason to doubt that it is a genuine
  oration of one of the contemporary orators. I agree with
  Böhnecke (Forschungen, p. 629) in thinking that it must have
  been delivered a few months after the convention with Alexander,
  before the taking of Thebes.

  κατέθετο πώποτε, ἀλλ᾽ ἔτι καὶ νῦν περιέρχεται καθ᾽ ὅσον δύναται,

  212, 214, 215, 220, where the orator speaks of Alexander as the
  τύραννος of Greece.

  The orator argues (p. 213) that the Macedonians had recognized
  despotism as contrary to the convention, in so far as to expel
  the despots from the towns of Antissa and Eresus in Lesbos. But
  probably these despots were in correspondence with the Persians
  on the opposite mainland, or with Memnon.

  [44] Demosth. ib. p. 215. τοὺς δ᾽ ἰδίους ὑμᾶς νόμους ἀναγκάζουσι
  λύειν, τοὺς μὲν κεκριμένους ἐν τοῖς δικαστηρίοις ἀφιέντες, ἕτερα
  δὲ παμπλήθη τοιαῦτα βιαζόμενοι παρανομεῖν....

At sea, the wrongful aggressions of Alexander or his officers had
been not less manifest than on land. The convention, guaranteeing
to all cities the right of free navigation, distinctly forbade each
to take or detain vessels belonging to any other. Nevertheless the
Macedonians had seized, in the Hellespont, all the merchantmen coming
out with cargoes from the Euxine, and carried them into Tenedos,
where they were detained, under various fraudulent pretences, in
spite of remonstrances from the proprietors and cities whose supply
of corn was thus intercepted. Among these sufferers, Athens stood
conspicuous; since consumers of imported corn, ship-owners, and
merchants, were more numerous there than elsewhere. The Athenians,
addressing complaints and remonstrances without effect, became at
length so incensed, and perhaps uneasy about their provisions,
that they passed a decree to equip and despatch 100 triremes,
appointing Menestheus (son of Iphikrates) admiral. By this strenuous
manifestation, the Macedonians were induced to release the detained
vessels. Had the detention been prolonged, the Athenian fleet would
have sailed to extort redress by force; so that, as Athens was more
than a match for Macedon on sea, the maritime empire of the latter
would have been overthrown, while even on land much encouragement
would have been given to malcontents against it.[45] Another incident
had occurred, less grave than this, yet still dwelt upon by the
orator as an infringement of the convention, and as an insult to
Athenians. Though an express article of the convention prohibited
armed ships of one city from entering the harbor of another, still
a Macedonian trireme had been sent into Pieræus to ask permission
that smaller vessels might be built there for Macedonian account.
This was offensive to a large proportion of Athenians, not only as
violating the convention, but as a manifest step towards employing
the nautical equipments and seamen of Athens for the augmentation of
the Macedonian navy.[46]

  We know that Alexander caused a squadron of ships to sail round
  to and up the Danube from Byzantium (Arrian, i. 3, 3), to meet
  him after his march by land from the southern coast of Thrace.
  It is not improbable that the Athenian vessels detained may have
  come loaded with a supply of corn, and that the detention of the
  corn-ships may have been intended to facilitate this operation.

“Let those speakers who are perpetually admonishing us to observe
the convention (the orator contends), prevail on the imperial chief
to set the example of observing it on his part. I too impress upon
you the like observance. To a democracy nothing is more essential
than scrupulous regard to equity and justice.[47] But the convention
itself enjoins all its members to make war against transgressors; and
pursuant to this article, you ought to make war against Macedon.[48]
Be assured that all Greeks will see that the war is neither directed
against them nor brought on by your fault.[49] At this juncture, such
a step for the maintenance of your own freedom as well as Hellenic
freedom generally, will be not less opportune and advantageous than
it is just.[50] The time is come for shaking off your disgraceful
submission to others, and your oblivion of our own past dignity.[51]
If you encourage me, I am prepared to make a formal motion—To declare
war against the violators of the convention, as the convention itself
directs.”[52]

A formal motion for declaring war would have brought upon the
mover a prosecution under the Graphê Paranomôn. Accordingly, though
intimating clearly that he thought the actual juncture (what it was,
we do not know) suitable, he declined to incur such responsibility
without seeing beforehand a manifestation of public sentiment
sufficient to give him hopes of a favorable verdict from the
Dikastery. The motion was probably not made. But a speech so bold,
even though not followed up by a motion, is in itself significant
of the state of feeling in Greece during the months immediately
following the Alexandrine convention. This harangue is only one among
many delivered in the Athenian assembly, complaining of Macedonian
supremacy as exercised under the convention. It is plain that the
acts of Macedonian officers were such as to furnish ample ground for
complaint; and the detention of all the trading ships coming out of
the Euxine, shows us that even the subsistence of Athens and the
islands had become more or less endangered. Though the Athenians
resorted to no armed interference, their assembly at least afforded
a theatre where public protest could be raised and public sympathy
manifested.

It is probable too that at this time Demosthenes and the other
anti-Macedonian speakers were encouraged by assurances and subsidies
from Persia. Though the death of Philip, and the accession of an
untried youth of twenty, had led Darius to believe for the moment
that all danger of Asiatic invasion was past, yet his apprehensions
were now revived by Alexander’s manifested energy, and by the renewal
of the Grecian league under his supremacy.[53] It was apparently
during the spring of 335 B. C., that Darius sent money to sustain
the anti-Macedonian party at Athens and elsewhere. Æschines affirms,
and Deinarchus afterwards repeats (both of them orators hostile
to Demosthenes)—That about this time, Darius sent to Athens 300
talents, which the Athenian people refused, but which Demosthenes
took, reserving however 70 talents out of the sum for his own
private purse: That public inquiry was afterwards instituted on the
subject. Yet nothing is alleged as having been made out;[54] at
least Demosthenes was neither condemned, nor even brought (as far
as appears) to any formal trial. Out of such data we can elicit no
specific fact. But they warrant the general conclusion, that Darius,
or the satraps in Asia Minor, sent money to Athens in the spring of
335 B. C., and letters or emissaries to excite hostilities against
Alexander.

  [53] Diodorus, xvii. 7.

  [54] Æschines adv. Ktesiph. p. 634; Deinarchus adv. Demosth. s.
  11-19, p. 9-14. It is Æschines who states that the 300 talents
  were sent to the Athenian people, and refused by them.

  Three years later, after the battle of Issus, Alexander in his
  letter to Darius accuses that prince of having sent both letters
  and money into Greece, for the purpose of exciting war against
  him. Alexander states that the Lacedæmonians accepted the money,
  but that all the other Grecian cities refused it (Arrian, ii. 14,
  9). There is no reason to doubt these facts; but I find nothing
  identifying the precise point of time to which Alexander alludes.

That Demosthenes, and probably other leading orators, received such
remittances from Persia, is no evidence of that personal corruption
which is imputed to them by their enemies. It is no way proved
that Demosthenes applied the money to his own private purposes. To
receive and expend it in trying to organize combinations for the
enfranchisement of Greece, was a proceeding which he would avow as
not only legitimate but patriotic. It was aid obtained from one
foreign prince to enable Hellas to throw off the worse dominion of
another. At this moment, the political interests of Persia coincided
with that of all Greeks who aspired to freedom. Darius had no chance
of becoming master of Greece; but his own security prescribed to
him to protect her from being made an appendage of the Macedonian
kingdom, and his means of doing so were at this moment ample, had
they been efficaciously put forth. Now the purpose of a Greek patriot
would be to preserve the integrity and autonomy of the Hellenic world
against all foreign interference. To invoke the aid of Persia against
Hellenic enemies,—as Sparta had done both in the Peloponnesian war
and at the peace of Antalkidas, and as Thebes and Athens had followed
her example in doing afterwards—was an unwarrantable proceeding: but
to invoke the same aid against the dominion of another foreigner, at
once nearer and more formidable, was open to no blame on the score
either of patriotism or policy. Demosthenes had vainly urged his
countrymen to act with energy against Philip, at a time when they
might by their own efforts have upheld the existing autonomy both for
Athens and for Greece generally. He now seconded or invited Darius,
at a time when Greece single-handed had become incompetent to the
struggle against Alexander, the common enemy both of Grecian liberty
and of the Persian empire. Unfortunately for Athens as well as for
himself, Darius, with full means of resistance in his hands, played
his game against Alexander even with more stupidity and improvidence
than Athens had played hers against Philip.

While such were the aggressions of Macedonian officers in the
exercise of their new imperial authority, throughout Greece and the
islands—and such the growing manifestations of repugnance to it at
Athens—Alexander had returned home to push the preparations for his
Persian campaign. He did not however think it prudent to transport
his main force into Asia, until he had made his power and personal
ascendency felt by the Macedonian dependencies, westward, northward,
and north-eastward of Pella—Illyrians, Pæonians, and Thracians.
Under these general names were comprised a number[55] of distinct
tribes, or nations, warlike and for the most part predatory. Having
remained unconquered until the victories of Philip, they were not
kept in subjection even by him without difficulty: nor were they at
all likely to obey his youthful successor, until they had seen some
sensible evidence of his personal energy.

  [55] Strabo speaks of the Thracian ἔθνη as twenty-two in number,
  capable of sending out 200,000 foot, and 15,000 horses (Strabo,
  vii. Fragm. Vatic. 48).

Accordingly, in the spring, Alexander put himself at the head of a
large force, and marched in an easterly direction from Amphipolis,
through the narrow Sapæan pass between Philippi and the sea.[56] In
ten days’ march he reached the difficult mountain path over which
alone he could cross Mount Hæmus (Balkan.) Here he found a body of
the free Thracians and of armed merchants of the country, assembled
to oppose his progress; posted on the high ground with waggons
in their front, which it was their purpose to roll down the steep
declivity against the advancing ranks of the Macedonians. Alexander
eluded this danger by ordering his soldiers either to open their
ranks, so as to let the waggons go through freely—or where there was
no room for such loose array, to throw themselves on the ground with
their shields closely packed together and slanting over their bodies;
so that the waggons, dashing down the steep and coming against the
shields, were carried off the ground, and made to bound over the
bodies of the men to the space below. All the waggons rolled down
without killing a single man. The Thracians, badly armed, were then
easily dispersed by the Macedonian attack, with the loss of 1500 men
killed, and all their women and children made prisoners.[57] The
captives and plunder were sent back under an escort to be sold at the
seaports.

  [56] Strabo, vii. p. 331 (Fragm.); Arrian, i. 1, 6; Appian, Bell.
  Civil. iv. 87, 105, 106. Appian gives (iv. 103) a good general
  description of the almost impassable and trackless country to the
  north and north-east of Philippi.

  [57] Arrian, i. 1, 12, 17. The precise locality of that steep
  road whereby Alexander crossed the Balkan, cannot be determined.
  Baron von Moltke, in his account of the Russian campaign in
  Bulgaria (1828-1829), gives an enumeration of four roads,
  passable by an army, crossing this chain from north to south (see
  chap. i. of that work). But whether Alexander passed by any one
  of these four, or by some other road still more to the west, we
  cannot tell.

Having thus forced the mountain road, Alexander led his army over the
chain of Mount Hæmus, and marched against the Triballi: a powerful
Thracian tribe,—extending (as far as can be determined) from the
plain of Kossovo in modern Servia northward towards the Danube,—whom
Philip had conquered, yet not without considerable resistance and
even occasional defeat. Their prince Syrmus had already retired with
the women and children of the tribe into an island of the Danube
called Peukê, where many other Thracians had also sought shelter. The
main force of the Triballi took post in woody ground on the banks of
the rivet Zyginus, about three days’ march from the Danube. Being
tempted however, by an annoyance from the Macedonian light-armed, to
emerge from their covered position into the open plain, they were
here attacked by Alexander with his cavalry and infantry, in close
combat, and completely defeated. Three thousand of them were slain,
but the rest mostly eluded pursuit by means of the wood, so that
they lost few prisoners. The loss of the Macedonians was only eleven
horsemen and forty foot slain; according to the statement of Ptolemy,
son of Lagus, then one of Alexander’s confidential officers, and
afterwards founder of the dynasty of Greco-Egyptian kings.[58]

  [58] Arrian, i. 2.

Three days’ march, from the scene of action, brought Alexander to the
Danube, where he found some armed ships which had been previously
ordered to sail (probably with stores of provision) from Byzantium
round by the Euxine and up the river. He first employed these ships
in trying to land a body of troops on the island of Peukê; but his
attempt was frustrated by the steep banks, the rapid stream, and
the resolute front of the defenders on shore. To compensate for
this disappointment, Alexander resolved to make a display of his
strength by crossing the Danube and attacking the Getæ; tribes,
chiefly horsemen armed with bows,[59] analogous to the Thracians
in habits and language. They occupied the left bank of the river,
from which their town was about four miles distant. The terror of
the Macedonian successes had brought together a body of 4000 Getæ,
visible from the opposite shore, to resist any crossing. Accordingly
Alexander got together a quantity of the rude boats (hollowed out of
a single trunk) employed for transport on the river, and caused the
tent-skins of the army to be stuffed with hay in order to support
rafts. He then put himself on shipboard during the night, and
contrived to carry across the river a body of 4000 infantry, and 1500
cavalry; landing on a part of the bank where there was high standing
wheat and no enemy’s post. The Getæ, intimidated not less by this
successful passage than by the excellent array of Alexander’s army,
hardly stayed to sustain a charge of cavalry, but hastened to abandon
their poorly fortified town and retire father away from the river.
Entering the town without resistance, he destroyed it, carried away
such movables as he found, and then returned to the river without
delay. Before he quitted the northern bank, he offered sacrifice to
Zeus the Preserver—to Hêraklês—and to the god Ister (Danube) himself,
whom he thanked for having shown himself not impassable.[60] On the
very same day, he recrossed the river to his camp; after an empty
demonstration of force, intended to prove that he could do what
neither his father nor any Grecian army had ever yet done, and what
every one deemed impossible—crossing the greatest of all known rivers
without a bridge and in the face of an enemy.[61]

  [59] Strabo, vii. p. 303.

  [60] Arrian, i. 4, 2-7.

  [61] Neither the point where Alexander crossed the Danube,—nor
  the situation of the island called Peukê,—nor the identity of the
  river Lyginus—nor the part of Mount Hæmus which Alexander forced
  his way over—can be determined. The data given by Arrian are too
  brief and too meagre to make out with assurance any part of his
  march after he crossed the Nestus. The facts reported by the
  historian represent only a small portion of what Alexander really
  did in this expedition.

  It seems clear, however, that the main purpose of Alexander
  was to attack and humble the Triballi. Their locality is known
  generally as the region where the modern Servia joins Bulgaria.
  They reached eastward (in the times of Thucydides, ii. 96) as
  far as the river Oskius or Isker, which crosses the chain of
  Hæmus from south to north, passes by the modern city of Sophia,
  and falls into the Danube. Now Alexander, in order to conduct
  his army from the eastern bank of the river Nestus, near its
  mouth, to the country of the Triballi, would naturally pass
  through Philippopolis, which city appears to have been founded
  by his father Philip, and therefore probably had a regular road
  of communication to the maritime regions. (See Stephanus Byz.
  v. Φιλιππόπολις.) Alexander would cross Mount Hæmus, then,
  somewhere north-west of Philippopolis. We read in the year 376
  B. C. (Diodor. xv. 36) of an invasion of Abdêra by the
  Triballi; which shows that there was a road, not unfit for an
  army, from their territory to the eastern side of the mouth of
  the river Nestus, where Abdêra was situated. This was the road
  which Alexander is likely to have followed. But he must probably
  have made a considerable circuit to the eastward; for the route
  which Paul Lucas describes himself as having taken direct from
  Philippopolis to Drama, can hardly have been fit for an army.

  The river Lyginus may perhaps be the modern Isker, but this is
  not certain. The Island called Peukê is still more perplexing.
  Strabo speaks of it as if it were near the mouth of the Danube
  (vii. p. 301-305). But it seems impossible that either the range
  of the Triballi, or the march of Alexander, can have extended so
  far eastward. Since Strabo (as well as Arrian) copied Alexander’s
  march from Ptolemy, whose authority is very good, we are
  compelled to suppose that there was a second island called Peukê
  higher up the river.

  The Geography of Thrace is so little known, that we cannot wonder
  at our inability to identify these places. We are acquainted, and
  that but imperfectly, with the two high roads, both starting from
  Byzantium or Constantinople. 1. The one (called the King’s Road,
  from having been in part the march of Xerxes in his invasion
  of Greece, Livy, xxxix. 27; Herodot. vii. 115) crossing the
  Hebrus and the Nestus, touching the northern coast of the Ægean
  Sea at Neapolis, a little south of Philippi, then crossing the
  Strymon at Amphipolis, and stretching through Pella across Inner
  Macedonia and Illyria to Dyrrachium (the Via Egnatia). 2. The
  other, taking a more northerly course, passing along the upper
  valley of the Hebrus from Adrianople to Philippopolis, then
  through Sardicia (Sophia) and Naissus (Nisch), to the Danube near
  Belgrade; being the high road now followed from Constantinople to
  Belgrade.

  But apart from these two roads, scarcely anything whatever is
  known of the country. Especially the mountainous region of
  Rhodopê, bounded on the west by the Strymon, on the north and
  east by the Hebrus, and on the south by the Ægean, is a Terra
  Incognita, except the few Grecian colonies on the coast. Very few
  travellers have passed along, or described the southern or King’s
  Road, while the region in the interior, apart from the high
  road, was absolutely unexplored until the visit of M. Viquesnel
  in 1847, under scientific mission from the French government.
  The brief, but interesting account, composed by M. Viquesnel,
  of this rugged and impracticable district, is contained in the
  “Archives des Missions Scientifiques et Litteraires”, for 1850,
  published at Paris. Unfortunately, the map intended to accompany
  that account has not yet been prepared; but the published data,
  as far as they go, have been employed by Kiepert in constructing
  his recent map of Turkey in Europe; the best map of these regions
  now existing, though still very imperfect. The Illustrations
  (Erläuterungen) annexed by Kiepert to his map of Turkey, show
  the defective data on which the chartography of this country is
  founded. Until the survey of M. Viquesnel, the higher part of the
  course of the Strymon, and nearly all the course of the Nestus,
  may be said to have been wholly unknown.

The terror spread by Alexander’s military operations was so great,
that not only the Triballi, but the other autonomous Thracians
around, sent envoys tendering presents or tribute, and soliciting
peace. Alexander granted their request. His mind being bent upon war
with Asia, he was satisfied with having intimidated these tribes so
as to deter them from rising during his absence. What conditions he
imposed, we do not know, but he accepted the presents.[62]

  [62] Arrian, i. 4, 5; Strabo, vii. p. 301.

While these applications from the Thracians were under debate, envoys
arrived from a tribe of Gauls occupying a distant mountainous region
westward towards the Ionic Gulf. Though strangers to Alexander,
they had heard so much of the recent exploits, that they came with
demands to be admitted to his friendship. They were distinguished
both for tall stature and for boastful language. Alexander readily
exchanged with them assurances of alliance. Entertaining them at a
feast, he asked, in the course of conversation, what it was that they
were most afraid of, among human contingencies? They replied, that
they feared no man, nor any danger, except only, lest the heaven
should fall upon them. Their answer disappointed Alexander, who had
expected that they would name him, as the person of whom they were
most afraid; so prodigious was his conceit of his own exploits. He
observed to his friends that these Gauls were swaggerers. Yet if we
attend to the sentiment rather than the language, we shall see that
such an epithet applies with equal or greater propriety to Alexander
himself. The anecdote is chiefly interesting as it proves at how
early an age the exorbitant self-esteem, which we shall hereafter
find him manifesting, began. That after the battle of Issus he should
fancy himself superhuman, we can hardly be astonished; but he was as
yet only in the first year of his reign, and had accomplished nothing
beyond his march into Thrace and his victory over the Triballi.

After arranging these matters, he marched in a south-westerly
direction into the territory of the Agriânes and the other Pæonians,
between the rivers Strymon and Axius in the highest portion of their
course. Here he was met by a body of Agriânes under their prince
Langarus, who had already contracted a personal friendship for him
at Pella before Philip’s death. News came that the Illyrian Kleitus,
son of Bardylis, who had been subdued by Philip, had revolted at
Pelion (a strong post south of lake Lychnidus, on the west side of
the chain of Skardus and Pindus, near the place where that chain is
broken by the cleft called the Klissura of Tzangon or Devol[63])—and
that the western Illyrians, called Taulantii, under their prince
Glaukias, were on the march to assist him. Accordingly Alexander
proceeded thither forthwith, leaving Langarus to deal with the
Illyrian tribe Autariatæ, who had threatened to oppose his progress.
He marched along the bank and up the course of the Erigon, from a
point near where it joins the Axius.[64] On approaching Pelion, he
found the Illyrians posted in front of the town and on the heights
around, awaiting the arrival of Glaukias their promised ally. While
Alexander was making his dispositions for attack, they offered their
sacrifices to the gods: the victims being three boys, three girls,
and three black rams. At first they stepped boldly forward to meet
him, but before coming to close quarters, they turned and fled into
the town with such haste that the slain victims were left lying
on the spot.[65] Having thus driven in the defenders, Alexander
was preparing to draw a wall of circumvallation round the Pelion,
when he was interrupted by the arrival of Glaukias with so large a
force as to compel him to abandon the project. A body of cavalry,
sent out from the Macedonian camp under Philotas to forage, were in
danger of being cut off by Glaukias, and were only rescued by the
arrival of Alexander himself with a reinforcement. In the face of
this superior force, it was necessary to bring off the Macedonian
army, through a narrow line of road along the river Eordaikus, where
in some places there was only room for four abreast, with hill or
marsh everywhere around. By a series of bold and skilful manœuvres,
and by effective employment of his battering-train or projectile
machines to protect the rear-guard, Alexander completely baffled
the enemy, and brought off his army without loss.[66] Moreover these
Illyrians, who had not known how to make use of such advantages of
position, abandoned themselves to disorder as soon as their enemy had
retreated, neglecting all precautions for the safety of their camp.
Apprised of this carelessness, Alexander made a forced night-march
back, at the head of his Agrianian division and light troops
supported by the remaining army. He surprised the Illyrians in their
camp before daylight. The success of this attack against a sleeping
and unguarded army was so complete, that the Illyrians fled at once
without resistance. Many were slain or taken prisoners; the rest,
throwing away their arms, hurried away homeward, pursued by Alexander
for a considerable distance. The Illyrian prince Kleitus was forced
to evacuate Pelion, which place he burned, and then retired into the
territory of Glaukias.[67]

  [63] For the situation of Pelion, compare Livy, xxxi. 33, 34, and
  the remarks of Colonel Leake, Travels in Northern Greece, vol.
  iii. ch. 28. p. 310-324.

  [64] Assuming Alexander to have been in the Territory of the
  Triballi, the modern Servia, he would in this march follow mainly
  the road which is now frequented between Belgrade and Bitolia;
  through the plain of Kossovo, Pristina, Katschanik (rounding
  on the north-eastern side the Ljubatrin, the north-eastern
  promontory terminating the chain of Skardus), Uschkub, Kuprili,
  along the higher course of the Axius or Vardar, until the point
  where the Erigon or Tscherna joins that river below Kuprili. Here
  he would be among the Pæonians and Agrianes, on the east—and the
  Dardani and Autariatæ, seemingly on the north and west. If he
  then followed the course of the Erigon, he would pass through
  the portions of Macedonia then called Deuripia and Pelagonia:
  he would go between the ridges of the mountains, through which
  the Erigon breaks, called Nidje on the south, and Babuna on the
  north. He would pass afterwards to Florina, and not to Bitolia.

  See Kiepert’s map of these regions—a portion of his recent map of
  Turkey in Europe—and Griesbach’s description of the general track.

Just as Alexander had completed this victory over Kleitus and the
Taulantian auxiliaries, and before he had returned home, news reached
him of a menacing character. The Thebans had declared themselves
independent of him, and were besieging his garrison in the Kadmeia.

Of this event, alike important and disastrous to those who stood
forward, the immediate antecedents are very imperfectly known to
us. It has already been remarked that the vote of submission on the
part of the Greeks to Alexander as Imperator, during the preceding
autumn, had been passed only under the intimidation of a present
Macedonian force. Though the Spartans alone had courage to proclaim
their dissent, the Athenians, Arcadians, Ætolians, and others, were
well known even to Alexander himself, as ready to do the like on
any serious reverse to the Macedonian arms.[68] Moreover the energy
and ability displayed by Alexander had taught the Persian king that
all danger to himself was not removed by the death of Philip, and
induced him either to send, or to promise, pecuniary aid to the
anti-Macedonian Greeks. We have already noticed the manifestation
of anti-Macedonian sentiment at Athens—proclaimed by several of
the most eminent orators—Demosthenes, Lykurgus, Hyperides, and
others; as well as by active military men like Charidemus and
Ephialtes,[69] who probably spoke out more boldly when Alexander was
absent on the Danube. In other cities, the same sentiment doubtless
found advocates, though less distinguished; but at Thebes, where
it could not be openly proclaimed, it prevailed with the greatest
force.[70] The Thebans suffered an oppression from which most of
the other cities were free—the presence of a Macedonian garrison
in their citadel; just as they had endured, fifty years before,
the curb of a Spartan garrison after the fraud of Phœbidas and
Leontiades. In this case, as in the former, the effect was to arm the
macedonizing leaders with absolute power over their fellow-citizens,
and to inflict upon the latter not merely the public mischief of
extinguishing all free speech, but also multiplied individual insults
and injuries, prompted by the lust and rapacity of rulers, foreign
as well as domestic.[71] A number of Theban citizens, among them
the freest and boldest spirits, were in exile at Athens, receiving
from the public indeed nothing beyond a safe home, but secretly
encouraged to hope for better things by Demosthenes and the other
anti-Macedonian leaders.[72] In like manner, fifty years before,
it was at Athens, and from private Athenian citizens, that the
Thebans Pelopidas and Mellon had found that sympathy which enabled
them to organize their daring conspiracy for rescuing Thebes from
the Spartans. That enterprise, admired throughout Greece as alike
adventurous, skilful, and heroic, was the model present to the
imagination of the Theban exiles, to be copied if any tolerable
opportunity occurred.

Such was the feeling in Greece, during the long absence of Alexander
on his march into Thrace and Illyria; a period of four or five
months, ending at August 335 B. C. Not only was Alexander
thus long absent, but he sent home no reports of his proceedings.
Couriers were likely enough to be intercepted among the mountains and
robbers of Thrace; and even if they reached Pella, their despatches
were not publicly read, as such communications would have been read
to the Athenian assembly. Accordingly we are not surprised to hear
that rumors arose of his having been defeated and slain. Among these
reports, both multiplied and confident, one was even certified by a
liar who pretended to have just arrived from Thrace, to have been
an eye-witness of the fact, and to have been himself wounded in
the action against the Triballi, where Alexander had perished.[73]
This welcome news, not fabricated, but too hastily credited, by
Demosthenes and Lykurgus,[74] was announced to the Athenian assembly.
In spite of doubts expressed by Demades and Phokion, it was believed
not only by the Athenians and the Theban exiles there present, but
also by the Arcadians, Eleians, Ætolians and other Greeks. For a
considerable time, through the absence of Alexander, it remained
uncontradicted, which increased the confidence in its truth.

  Alexander) καὶ παρὰ πολλῶν ἐφοίτα, ὅτι τε χρόνον ἀπῆν οὐκ ὀλίγον

  Justin, xi. 2. “Demosthenem oratorem, qui Macedonum deletas omnes
  cum rege copias à Triballis affirmaverit, producto in concionem
  auctore, qui in eo praelio, in quo rex ceciderit, se quoque
  vulneratum diceret.”

  Compare Tacitus, Histor. i. 34. “Vix dum egresso Pisone, occisum
  in castris Othonem, vagus primum et incertus rumor, mox, ut _in
  magnis mendaciis, interfuisse se quidam, et vidisse affirmabant_,
  credulà famâ inter gaudentes et incuriosos.... Obvius in
  palatio Julius Atticus, speculator, cruentum gladium ostentans,
  occisum _à se_ Othonem exclamavit.”

  It is stated that Alexander was really wounded in the head by a
  stone, in the action with the Illyrians (Plutarch, Fortun. Alex.
  p. 327).

It was upon the full belief in this rumor, of Alexander’s defeat and
death, that the Grecian cities proceeded. The event severed by itself
their connection with Macedonia. There was neither son nor adult
brother to succeed to the throne: so that not merely the foreign
ascendency, but even the intestine unity, of Macedonia, was likely
to be broken up. In regard to Athens, Arcadia, Elis, Ætolia, etc.,
the anti-Macedonian sentiment was doubtless vehemently manifested,
but no special action was called for. It was otherwise in regard
to Thebes. Phœnix, Prochytes, and other Theban exiles at Athens,
immediately laid their plan for liberating their city and expelling
the Macedonian garrison from the Kadmeia. Assisted with arms and
money by Demosthenes and other Athenian citizens, and invited by
their partisans at Thebes, they suddenly entered that city in arms.
Though unable to carry the Kadmeia by surprise, they seized in the
city, and put to death, Amyntas, a principal Macedonian officer, with
Timolaus, one of the leading macedonizing Thebans.[75] They then
immediately convoked a general assembly of the Thebans, to whom they
earnestly appealed for a vigorous effort to expel the Macedonians,
and reconquer the ancient freedom of the city. Expatiating upon the
misdeeds of the garrison and upon the oppressions of those Thebans
who governed by means of the garrison, they proclaimed that the happy
moment of liberation had now arrived, through the recent death of
Alexander. They doubtless recalled the memory of Pelopidas, and the
glorious enterprise, cherished by all Theban patriots, whereby he had
rescued the city from Spartan occupation, forty-six years before. To
this appeal the Thebans cordially responded. The assembly passed a
vote, declaring severance from Macedonia, and autonomy of Thebes—and
naming as Bœotarchs some of the returned exiles, with others of
the same party, for the purpose of energetic measures against the
garrison in the Kadmeia.[76]

  75. p. 53.

Unfortunately for Thebes, none of these new Bœotarchs were men of
the stamp of Epaminondas, probably not even of Pelopidas. Yet
their scheme, though from its melancholy result it is generally
denounced as insane, really promised better at first than that of
the anti-Spartan conspirators in 380 B. C. The Kadmeia was instantly
summoned; hopes being perhaps indulged, that the Macedonian commander
would surrender it with as little resistance as the Spartan harmost
had done. But such hopes were not realized. Philip had probably
caused the citadel to be both strengthened and provisioned. The
garrison defied the Theban leaders, who did not feel themselves
strong enough to give orders for an assault, as Pelopidas in his
time was prepared to do, if surrender had been denied.[77] They
contented themselves with drawing and guarding a double line of
circumvallation round the Kadmeia, so as to prevent both sallies
from within and supplies from without.[78] They then sent envoys in
the melancholy equipment of suppliants
